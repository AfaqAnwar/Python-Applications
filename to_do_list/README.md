# To-Do List

This is a simple console based to-do list.
Allows for the creation of a list that can be saved and accessed. 
List items may be changed either by appending more items, or removing existing ones.

## Notes
This to-do list "application" is extremely simple and was meant to serve as an introduction 
to pickling (making serializable) objects within Python.
